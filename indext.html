      <h2>Chicken</h2>
        <p>Raw chicken may contain salmonella. The safe minimum cooking temperature recommended by the U.S. Department of Health
         & Human Services is 165 째F (74 째C) to prevent foodborne illness because of bacteria and parasites.[25] However, in Japan raw chicken is
          sometimes consumed in a dish called torisashi,
          which is sliced raw chicken served in sashimi style. Another preparation is toriwasa which is lightly seared on the outsides
          while the inside remains raw.
           Chicken can be cooked in many ways. It can be made into sausages, skewered, put in salads, traditionally grilled or by using
          cultures. Historically common methods include roasting, baking, broasting, and frying. Western cuisine frequently has chicken
          prepared by deep frying for fast foods such as fried chicken, chicken nuggets, chicken lollipops or buffalo wings. They are also
          o ften grilled for salads or tacos.
          Chickens often come with labels such as "roaster", which suggest a method of cooking based on the type of chicken. While these
          labels are only suggestions, ones labeled for stew often do not do well when cooked with other methods.[27]
          Some chicken breast cuts and processed chicken breast products include the moniker "with rib meat". This is a misnomer, as
          it is the small piece of white meat that overlays the scapula, and is removed with the breast meat. The breast is cut from the chicken
          and sold as a solid cut, while the leftover breast and true rib meat is stripped from the bone through mechanical separation for use in
           chicken franks, for example. Breast meat is often sliced thinly and marketed as chicken slices, an easy filling for sandwiches. Often, the tenderloin (pectoralis minor) is marketed separately from the breast (pectoralis major). In the US,
          "tenders" can be either tenderloins or strips cut from the breast. In the UK the strips of pectoralis minor are called "chicken mini-fillets".
           Chicken bones are hazardous to health as they tend to break into sharp splinters when eaten, but they can be simmered with vegetables
           and herbs for hours or even days to make chicken stock
